<h2>HTML</h2>
<strong><a href="https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1168097&cid=40942&categoryId=32838" title="about html">It is a type of web language used to create documents that can be viewed through the World Wide Web, one of the Internet services.</a>
It was developed specifically to write hypertext, and most web pages accessed over the web from the Internet are written in <u>HTML</u>.</strong>
<br><p>HTML was created to define the formatting of electronic documents and was defined as a subset of the international standard SGML.
HTML is a language created in SGML with particular emphasis on hypertext, consisting of generic text in ASCII code.</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">This language does not require a separate compiler, and is gaining popularity as an easy-to-use language that can be interpreted by web browsers.
HTML is used to create a homepage as a command to define the size, color, shape, graphic, and movement of documents (hyperlink).
The command used in HTML is called a tag, which is represented by the square bracket . Typically, a tag is made up of two pairs,
beginning and ending, but sometimes only the start tag, such as tags such as "img" and "br", and the name of the end tag begins with a slash character[/].
As such, documents written in HTML are referred to as HTML documents and are interpreted by a web browser to show them to users.
In HTML, a document recognizes a separate code, creating a complete hypertext, as well as linking words or paragraphs to other places or files on the Internet.</p>
